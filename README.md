# php-fread-blockchain
A simple PHP script that prints the blocks and transactions from bitcoin's blk*.dat files.

Just set the location to where your blk.dat files are kept (probably /home/user/.bitcoin/blocks) and run the script in a terminal:

`php fread.php`

Then sit back and watch all the blocks and transactions.
